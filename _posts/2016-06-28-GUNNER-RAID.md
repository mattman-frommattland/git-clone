This week we got further on with our games. I have had a couple of problems but the teacher helped me get over them. My game is like dodgeball but is called gunner raid. It's a shame the Micro Bits haven't arrived yet. I look forward to playing these games. Next week we are moving onto a new topic. I wander what?
