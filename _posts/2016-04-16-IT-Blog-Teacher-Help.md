This week our teacher showed us Eshen's Prezi on the History of Computers. There were lots of spelling mistakes and it wasn't in chronological order. Our teacher then gave us some tips. Here they are:

* Spelling

* Grammar

* Don't overload the page

* In your own words

* Don't copy and paste

* Reasonable font size

* Make it flow

* Layout

* Read over the prezi

Then our homework was to go over the prezi and check all of these things.
