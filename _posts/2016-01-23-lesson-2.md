**lesson 2**

First our teacher read out some statements. we had to go to one side of the room (yes or no). Then we watched an advert on the biggest loser. It made the program look very excited but actually it is a group of fat people trying to lose weight. I wasn't very impressed as I thought it was rubbish. 

Then we watched how the burgers for the mcdonald's adverts were made compared to a shop. They put effort to make the burger good looking and they put the burgers from the shops together in about a minute.
