media literacy lesson

yesterday we were asked how many media types we knew. we got quite a few. Eg. social media, video media etc. then we there given a table on a piece of paper. it had lots of different statements on it like 'this person can access the internet whenever they like.' so we were told to go round the class trying to find as many people as we could so we could fill everything in. once we had all tried, we came to the front again and our teacher told us, "you can not possibly get the can access internet one because you are at school. so as we neared the end of the lesson we carried on talking about this and then we left.
