I found it fun to make my identity map. I thought it wasn't too hard. 

I was happy to share with the class. I thought it was fine for people to see what I had done. 

I enjoyed commenting on other people's identity maps as it would help them if we did it again. 

I did enjoy this process and it would have been awkward at moments if we were commenting to the person.

I enjoyed to get back the comments and I was not surprised at what they said. 

It is different to commenting online because nothing offensive could have been said and we know each other very well.

My identity map did not really say what I would post on social media in the future but did say what media I would use.

No. I don't think I would change my media use based on this activity.

Yes. I now look at media as useful for jobs, but you have to be safe on them.

I think the lessons may have made me a bit more careful if I were to use YouTube, Twitter or Facebook.
