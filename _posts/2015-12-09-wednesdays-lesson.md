On wednesday's lesson we discussed how trustworthy wikipedia really is. Most people gave around an 8 out of 10. actually, wikipedia is more trustworthy than that. It is true that anyone can change the facts on wikipedia but a group of nerds check it every so often to make it correct. So actually, wikipedia is more reliable than you think. Also, we talked about how biased the news can be. For example, during the Scottish referendum, the bbc were saying things like, "There is no one supporting independence." if you went on social media, you would  have seen thousands of people supporting independence.
