This lesson we talked briefly about our blog and then we came up to the front of the classroom and watched a video called first to a million. It was basically where two groups (one with the sister one with the brother) aphid a challenge which was to get 1,000,000 views on YouTube before a party. The video let you make choices (by giving a link to another video) and finding out the consequences.

I think it was a good thing to watch and it helps see the effects of your decisions.
