We began the lesson by looking at some scenarios. Serious to not so serious. Things like "post pictures of their cat" to “posts that they are going on holiday and their house is empty”. There was also “ playing an online game with the stranger and chatting”. Then we discussed it. We talked about our order.

Then we discussed about how we feel connected.

We were then told to make a guideline of ten positive uses of social media.

Here it is…

1. You shouldn't post embarrassing things about you or another person.

2. You shouldn't post things that you wouldn't want your *nan* to see.

3. You can talk to strangers but do not give away any personal details.

4. Only say positive things, try not to hurt anyones feelings

5. Do not say things you would not want to be said to you.

6. Use Common sense and try to be safe. Also think about your future rather than impressing friends.

7. Be careful not to get drawn into someone else's thoughts or behaviour.

8. Do not blackmail people into doing things.

9. Be accurate in what you write. People may interpret things differently to what you mean.

10. HAVE FUN

            BE SAFE 

            BE RESPONSIBLE!

Then we watched a short video. 1 person without her phone felt alone. Then we watched another short video. It was mocking Twitter saying it took over your life.
