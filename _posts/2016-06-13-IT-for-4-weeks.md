In the past four lesson we have been carrying on working with Javascript programing for the microbits (when they arrive). I am now becoming used to the programing and I think that I will be able to make my own game that has been set. Javascript has become familiar to me now. I now have less struggles. I am excited to make my own game and I hope that it goes well like most of the other tutorials went. We also did a survey on technology usage in which we were told to answer honestly. We have now began our game planning. My game is called DODGEBALL MAX. It's in the name. Here is my planing.

Game Plan

1) Name of Game

DODGEBALL MAX

2) Purpose of game

The purpose is so the balls that come from the top and bottom of the screen with you in the middle. The number will become greater with each level that passes.

3) Number of players

4) What inputs will the game have?

Button A and Button B

5) What processes will the program calculate?
